# âœ… Type of Testing

#### Regression Testing

To test the application thoroughly in order to confirm that the existing applications still work and the new feature doesn't break any existing features.

Automation testing helps in regression testing

Frequently failed TCs can be included.

Integration TCs can be included.

#### Smoke Testing / Sanity Testing

Smoke test - test each time when a push is made (test only high level not everything)

Each time when the code gets pushed to the repository then 'Smoke/sanity' testing happens.

it takes less than 5 mins.

#### Difference between Integration and component testing

component testing - a module (eg. register page)

Integration testing - combination of two components

Eg. click on a specific course and it lands in specific course page.

#### Diff between Verification and Validation

Verify the component if its working fine.

Validate the component if it is working as expected so that it can be accepted or rejected.

#### UAT testing(User acceptance testing)/STAGE env.

Testing done by client after testing the product thoroughly&#x20;

#### Load Testing&#x20;

Load Testing : Load Testing help us to study the behavior of the application under various loads. The main parameter to focus is response time. This study reveals how many concurrent users that server can handle effectively and quickly.

**Stress Testing : **Stress Testing help us to observe the stability of the application. The main intention is to identify the breaking point of the server

Smoke Testing is **performed to ascertain that the critical functionalities of the program are working fine**. Sanity testing is done at random to verify that each functionality is working as expected. Smoke testing exercises the entire system from end to end.
